//Overview:
PRSEK is a custom-built Twitch bot designed to seamlessly interface with the "Songify" Windows application, enabling real-time song requests and playback control directly from a Twitch chat. The bot acts as a bridge between Twitch viewers and the Songify application, allowing streamers to enhance viewer engagement by letting their audience influence the music played during live streams.

//Key Features:

//Chat Command Integration:

PRSEK listens to specific chat commands issued by viewers in the Twitch channel.

Commands such as !songrequest <song_name> or !sr <song_name> allow viewers to request songs to be played via Songify.

The bot parses these commands and forwards the song requests to the Songify application.

//Songify API Interaction:

PRSEK communicates with Songify through a custom API or inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism, depending on the capabilities of the Songify application.

The bot sends song titles or identifiers to Songify, which then queues and plays the requested songs.

//Request Queue Management:

PRSEK maintains a request queue to manage multiple song requests from viewers.

The queue ensures that songs are played in the order they are requested, preventing conflicts and ensuring fairness.

Streamers can configure the maximum queue length and set cooldown periods to prevent spam.

//Moderation and Permissions:

The bot includes moderation features to prevent abuse, such as blacklisting certain songs or users.

Streamers can set permissions to restrict song requests to subscribers, VIPs, or moderators only.

PRSEK can also detect and filter out inappropriate or duplicate requests.

//Real-Time Feedback:

PRSEK provides real-time feedback in the Twitch chat, confirming when a song request has been successfully added to the queue.

The bot can also notify viewers when their requested song is about to play or if there are any issues (e.g., song not found).

//Customizable Settings:

Streamers can customize PRSEK's behavior through a configuration file or a web-based dashboard.

Settings include command prefixes, cooldown timers, queue limits, and integration with other Twitch features like channel points.

//Error Handling and Logging:

PRSEK includes robust error handling to manage issues such as invalid song requests, API failures, or Songify crashes.

The bot logs all activities and errors for troubleshooting and analytics purposes.

//Technical Specifications:

Programming Language: PRSEK is developed in Python, leveraging libraries such as twitchio for Twitch API interaction and pywin32 or socket for interfacing with the Songify application on Windows.

API/Protocol: The bot uses RESTful API calls, WebSocket communication, or custom IPC protocols to interact with Songify, depending on the application's supported integration methods.

//Hosting: PRSEK can be hosted on a local machine, a dedicated server, or a cloud-based platform, ensuring low latency and high availability during live streams.

//Compatibility: The bot is compatible with Windows operating systems where the Songify application is installed and running.
